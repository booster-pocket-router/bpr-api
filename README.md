# bpr-api
Programmatically interact with settings and measurements

## Goal
This project develops the API to programmatically interact with the booster pocket router. 

## Execution
The server can be started using `mix deps.get && mix phx.server` from the command line*. The API is then reachable at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).

\* This project is developed and tested on MacOS. So far, we do not conduct cross-plattform tests.
